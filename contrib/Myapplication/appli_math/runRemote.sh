# --- run command in SALOME environment from remote call, ssh or rsh
#     - SALOME configuration is defined by :
#        - list of MODULE_ROOT_DIR
#        - prerequisite environment
#        - specific configuration for a particular SALOME application
#     - These elements of configuration are defined locally on each computer
#       in the directory APPLI:
#     - A SALOME application distributed on several computers needs APPLI
#       directories on the same path ($APPLI) relative to $HOME directory
#       of the user, on each computer.
# --- call example (from cli76cd to cli76ce):
# ssh cli76ce ${APPLI}/runRemote.sh cli76cd 2810 SALOME_Container myContainerName
# --- local arguments
#     $0 : ${APPLI}/runRemote.sh: from arg name, rebuild and export $APPLI variable
#     $1 : computer name for CORBA name service (where SALOME was launched)
#     $2 : port for CORBA name service
#     $3 : WORKINGDIR (if $3 == WORKINDIR a working dir is given in $4. If not the working dir is $HOME)
#     $4 : if $3 == WORKINGDIR, the path to the workingdir
#     $5 (or $3 if no workingdir given) and following : local command to execute, with args
# --- retrieve APPLI path, relative to $HOME, set ${APPLI}
